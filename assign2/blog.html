        <h3><strong>Question 1</strong></h3>
        <p class = "answer"> Most challenging is trying to understand the format of HTML page, after that<br>
        things go more smoothly and I solved it by reading the entire html page again and again.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Question 2</strong></h3>
        <p class = "answer"> I have a bit of deeper knowledge about flex boxes and creating boxes now.<br>
        For what I already knew would be just changing colors, fonts and photo sizes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Question 3</strong></h3>
        <p class = "answer">Most of the things, I learnt from the lectures but there are things that I missed<br>
        or things that I don't know, I used google to search up the things that I want to do. For example, how<br>
        to fill the entire column with color. I had help from the discord group too. One good website would be<br>
        "Flexbox froggy", I played that little game to understand better about flexboxes and it really helps.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Question 4</strong></h3>
        <p class = "answer">I googled on how to fill columns with color and more detailed knowledge about flex<br>
        boxes.</p>
