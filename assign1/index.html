            <h3><strong>Question 1</strong></h3>
            <p class = "answer">    I have never done web development, so the most complicated thing I have done so far is creating a simple<br>
            information website with photos and external link. I also link it to the css file to change font styles and<br>
            colors.</p>

            <h3><strong>Question 2</strong></h3>
            <p class = "answer"> From this class, I hope that I will understand html, css and javascript enough to make my own really<br>
            advance websites.</p>

            <h3><strong>Question 3</strong></h3>
            <p class = "answer"> Yes, I have already signed up for the Piazza forum.</p>

            <h3><strong>Question 4</strong></h3>
            <p class = "answer">An interesting fact would be studying abroad to the United States. I came to corvallis alone without<br>
            without my parents or any relatives, so it was the first time travelling alone on the plane and everything.<br>
            Everything is shocking living somewhere people don't speak your language and that is my most unique <br>
            experience of my life.</p>
